# SmartExit

### Description
Small tool for simplifying the ["x-log"](http://tibia.wikia.com/wiki/X-Logging) action in the MMORPG Tibia. Instead of shutting down the client altogether, only the connection to Tibia is shut down, making you end up in the character selection window. Ready to log back in within seconds.
